# FRED
Federal Registry Endpoint Describer

The Federal Registry Endpoint Describer (FRED) is a tool used to jsonify the federal register's [interactive documentation](https://www.federalregister.gov/developers/api/v1). The purpose of FRED is to allow for the automated and simple generation of federal register API's (including my own python library for the API [FRPA]()).
